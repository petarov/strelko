.:Strelko Server:.
=============================

Strelko is a small footprint HTTP server. 

The goal is the provide swift file hosting solution for web developers, designers and others. In the ideal case **Strelko** would be the perfect solution for testing your web project directly on the development machine. This being said **Strelko** pretty much mimics the functionality of the command:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Pros that **Strelko** may offer are:
* multi-threading support
* minumal runtime requirements ( *just one binary* )
* slightly faster ( *not confirmed* )

**Note** that it is highly **unrecommended** to use this HTTP server on any productive system!
