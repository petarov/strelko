=============================

# Summary
General purpose of the e-additives project is to provide detailed information about food additives, e.g., details, status, 
side effects and others. 
*e-additives Server* is a HTTP server implementation in C that serves food additives data through RESTful services. 
The server is being implemented using Apache Portable Runtime Project - [APR](http://apr.apache.org/) as base.

# Food additives information
## What are food additives ?
As [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive) says: Food additives are substances added to food to preserve 
flavor or improve its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by 
pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as in some wines. With the 
advent of processed foods in the second half of the 20th century, many more additives have been introduced, of both 
natural and artificial origin.

## What are E numbers ?
E numbers are number codes for food additives that have been assessed for use within the European Union (i.e. E121, E415, 
E900, etc.). They are commonly found on food labels throughout the European Union. E numbers are also encountered on food 
labeling in other jurisdictions, including the GCC, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. They are increasingly found on 
North American packaging, especially in Canada on imported European products
